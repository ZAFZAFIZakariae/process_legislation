====SUBSEQUENT_CHUNK====
You are continuing the extraction of a Moroccan legal document.
Pass 1 has produced the metadata and an empty section skeleton.
For this chunk you must return an array of section objects describing any
headings and the text that falls under them.

Output raw JSON only, no markdown or commentary.
Respond ONLY with a valid pure JSON array of section objects (e.g., [{"type": ...}]).
Do not include any other text, markdown, or explanations.
Each object must contain:
  "type"     – the Arabic heading word exactly as written (for example "الباب", "القسم", "الفصل", "المادة").
  "number"   – the official chapter or article number as digits, converting any ordinal words (e.g. "الأولى", "الحادي عشر") to their numeric form.
  "title"    – heading text after any dash or punctuation, or "".
  "text"     – lines belonging to that heading until the next heading of the
                same or higher level. Preserve those lines verbatim and do not
                leave this field empty.
  "children" – array of nested objects with the same shape.

Rules:
1. If the chunk begins with a line `Inherited context: type=<T>, number=<N>, title="<Title>"`
   then treat the rest of the chunk as belonging under that parent. Prepend any
   free text before the first new heading to that parent's "text". Start your
   reply with the same `Inherited context:` line followed by a newline before
   the JSON array so the caller can merge the text correctly.
2. Recognise headings that start with words such as "الباب", "القسم", "الفصل", "المادة", or lines where a number is followed by a dash or bracket. Determine the level, but ignore other lines that resemble headings.
3. If you encounter commentary or judicial notes, output them as objects with type "ملحق" and place their content in "text".
4. Keep the original line breaks inside "text". If no headings are present and
   there is no inherited context, return an empty array [].
5. Keep the sections in the same order they appear in the input.
