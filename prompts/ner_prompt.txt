And identify **all** relations between them, of types:

  • enacted_by         (LAW ← DECRET)  
  • published_in       (LAW ← OFFICIAL_JOURNAL)  
  • effective_on       (LAW/DECRET ← DATE)

  • clerk_for          (COURT_CLERK → COURT)  
  • prosecuted_by      (CASE → ATTORNEY_GENERAL)  
  • refers_to          (INTERNAL_REF → any entity)

**Output** a single JSON object with two keys:
```json
{
  "entities": [ /* list of entity objects */ ],
  "relations": [ /* list of relation objects */ ]
}

Each **entity** object must have:
{
  "id":          <incremental number starting at 1>,
  "type":        "<one of the entity types above>",
  "text":        "<surface form>",
  "start_char":  <offset into the text, 0-based>,
  "end_char":    <offset into the text>,
  "normalized":  "<canonical form—for dates ISO YYYY-MM-DD, for laws/decrets the number, for names a latin transcription, etc.>"
}

Each relation object must have:
{
  "relation_id": <incremental number starting at 1>,  
  "type":        "<one of the relation types above>",
  "source_id":   <entity.id of the source>,
  "target_id":   <entity.id of the target>
}

Be exhaustive and precise. Use temperature=0.
