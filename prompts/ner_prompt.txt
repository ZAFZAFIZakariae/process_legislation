  • amended_by         (LAW → LAW)  
  • implements         (AGENCY → LAW)  
  • decides            (COURT → CASE)  
  • judged_by          (CASE → JUDGE)  
  • represented_by     (CASE → LAWYER)  
  • clerk_for          (COURT_CLERK → COURT)  
  • prosecuted_by      (CASE → ATTORNEY_GENERAL)  
  • refers_to          (INTERNAL_REF → any entity)  
  • jumps_to           (INTERNAL_REF → CHAPTER/SECTION)  

**Output** a single JSON object with two keys:
```json
{
  "entities": [ /* list of entity objects */ ],
  "relations": [ /* list of relation objects */ ]
}

Each **entity** object must have:
{
  "id":          <incremental number starting at 1>,
  "type":        "<one of the entity types above>",
  "text":        "<surface form>",
  "start_char":  <offset into the text, 0-based>,
  "end_char":    <offset into the text>,
  "normalized":  "<canonical form—for dates use ISO YYYY-MM-DD; for laws or decrees include the number plus the law type in Arabic script, e.g. '1.11.91 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0647\u064a\u0631 \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641' or '29.93 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645\u064a'; for articles, chapters and sections use the number followed by the heading in Arabic like '1 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0628' or '7 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644'; keep all names in Arabic script without transliteration; etc.>"
}

Each relation object must have:
{
  "relation_id": <incremental number starting at 1>,  
  "type":        "<one of the relation types above>",
  "source_id":   <entity.id of the source>,
  "target_id":   <entity.id of the target>
}

Be exhaustive and precise. Use temperature=0.
